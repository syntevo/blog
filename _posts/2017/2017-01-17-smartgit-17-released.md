We are proud to announce the official release of [SmartGit 17](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/). The first and obvious change is the new version numbering - as usual according to the year.

We have taken the SmartGit user feedback at [smartgit.userecho.com](https://smartgit.userecho.com) seriously and implemented some of the most requested features. Hence, the most important new features are the a real **dark theme**, **rename detection** for uncommitted changes in the working tree, **base-file display** for the Conflict Solver and **DeepGit integration**, a tool for an sophisticated analysis of the file history. Check out [What's New](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/whatsnew) for a more detailed list of improvements in version 17.

SmartGit is a graphical front-end for the distributed version control systems Git which also can be used to work with Subversion repositories. SmartGit runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

SmartGit can be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes (e.g. by OpenSource developers, students or certain wellfare institutions). For commercial use or if support is needed, you can [purchase commercial licenses](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase). The commercial licenses include up to 3 years of e-mail support and up to life-long free updates. For early adopters, we are offering up to **40% early adopter discount** until February 5th 2017.
