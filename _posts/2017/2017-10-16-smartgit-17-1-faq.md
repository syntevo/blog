###### Stash: where is the "Include untracked files" checkbox?

It has been moved into the preferences, "Commands" page.

###### Push To: where is the "Force pushing" checkbox?

It only was there because of a bug. For forced-push, you will need to select the "Allow modifying pushed commits" checkbox in the preferences, "Commands" page.
