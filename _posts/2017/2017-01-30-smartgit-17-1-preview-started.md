The first public build of SmartGit 17.1 is available for download.

The existing commands for modifying commits have been enhanced by a "Rebase Interactive" command to batch-process multiple operations and a Split Commit command. DeepGit, the sophisticated history analysis tool, is now part of SmartGit. For better managing ignored files you now can reveal either the matching or all ignore files of your repository. SmartGit 17.1 allows to stash only selected changes instead of always all.
