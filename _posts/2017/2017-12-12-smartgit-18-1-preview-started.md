The first public build of **SmartGit 18.1** is available for download.

The Journal and Log have been rewritten for **better performance**, improved layout and **easier to understand** default coloring. For the built-in SSH client a new library is now used that supports **newer SSH servers** and **higher transfer rates**. SmartGit concentrates on 64-bit support: the Windows portable and installer bundles come with 64-bit JRE and Git, and the Linux bundle now also comes with (64-bit) JRE.
