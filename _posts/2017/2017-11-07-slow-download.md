If you have a slow download from our webserver, please verify what exactly is the bottle-neck. On Windows, you can run the `tracert` command:

`tracert www.syntevo.com`

On OS X and Linux run `traceroute` instead:

`traceroute www.syntevo.com`

Finally, please send us the resulting output to [info@syntevo.com](info@syntevo.com).
