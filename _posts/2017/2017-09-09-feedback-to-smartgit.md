We want to better understand the needs of our SmartGit users. What are the **key benefits** of SmartGit and at which areas does SmartGit lack features or **needs polishing**? Please

- request **new features** at [smartgit.userecho.com](https://smartgit.userecho.com/),
- share the **pros** and **cons** at slant.co (for [Linux](https://www.slant.co/topics/242/viewpoints/1/~best-graphical-git-clients-for-linux~smartgit), [Mac](https://www.slant.co/topics/465/viewpoints/7/~best-git-clients-for-macos~smartgit) or [Windows](https://www.slant.co/topics/2089/viewpoints/2/~git-clients-for-windows~smartgit)) or
- vote at [alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/software/smartgit/).

Thanks for your time and help!
