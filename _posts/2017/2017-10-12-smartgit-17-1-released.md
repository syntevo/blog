We have taken the SmartGit user feedback at [smartgit.userecho.com](https://smartgit.userecho.com) seriously and implemented some of the most requested features. Beside **faster refreshing** especially for larger repositories, optional **compact display** of changes and optional **display of line-ending** changes, **interactive rebase** supplementing the modifying and rearranging commands in the Journal, several **stash improvements** a lot of other areas have been polished. Check out [What's New](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/whatsnew) for a more detailed list of improvements in version 17.1.
