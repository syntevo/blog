For [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/), our graphical Git client, the first public preview build for the upcoming version 3 is available. The most important changes are the use of a different GUI library to make SmartGit look native (SWT instead of AWT/Swing) and performance improvements ([detailed change log](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/changelog-eap.txt)).

You are welcome to give it a try!
