The **2nd release candidate** (RC) of the upcoming **SmartGit 8** is available.

The most important feature of SmartGit 8 is the **Journal** that replaces the previous Outgoing view and offers a focused and compact view onto the current branch, its tracked branch and one arbitrary branch. That way for most operations the Log dialogs or the Log are not required any more.
