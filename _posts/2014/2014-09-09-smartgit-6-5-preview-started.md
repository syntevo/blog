The first public preview build for the upcoming SmartGit version 6.5 is available. The most important changes are:

- External Tools are more powerful
- Improved memory consumption
- Log file/content filters
- auto-update across major versions
- Distributed Reviews: better handling of pull request heads

### Update from September-12:

Beside other fixes, the second preview build fixes a nasty problem for users of the non-commercial edition. Those who could not start the first build successfully, please download the second preview build. For all others, it should update automatically.

You are welcome to give it a try!
