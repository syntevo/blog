The first public build of **SmartGit 22.1** is available for download.

Its most important new feature is the new **Standard window** that combines a dedicated view for Local Changes with a History (Graph) view. It is meant for learning Git easier in a safer (less powerful) environment as well as offering all necessary commands for daily Git usage, e.g. committing into feature branches.

**Update:** To use the Standard window you need to have a commercial license registered and have at least build 19032 (use Help | Check for Latest Build to get it):
