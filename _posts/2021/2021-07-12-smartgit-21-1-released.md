We are delighted to announce the official release of [SmartGit 21.1](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/). First, we want to thank all users who have tested the preview versions and provided valuable feedback. Without you, the progress would not have been possible!

We have taken the SmartGit user feedback seriously and implemented some of the most requested features. SmartGit 21.1 comes with

- rewritten Changes view with **image compare**, optional **unified diff**, full **syntax coloring** (even with compact display),
- improved **conflict solving** (visual selection of ours/theirs),
- **Azure DevOps** integration,
- **avatars** used in graph - even if the gravatars.com access is deselected,
- the **JIRA** integration can set issues in-progress,
- **cherrying-pick files** (or parts of stashes),
- **partial clone** support,
- easier **split commits**,
- **"Commit debugger"** (step from commit to commit),
- and improved a lot of other existing features.
