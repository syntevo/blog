The good news: **none of our recent product versions is using Log4J**:

- SmartGit 18.1 and newer
- SmartSVN 9.3 and newer
- SmartSynchronize 3.5 and newer
- DeepGit 4.0 and newer

However, Log4J 1.x was used by older versions of our products:

- SmartGit 17.1 and older
- SmartSVN 9.2 and older
- SmartSynchronize 3.4 and older
- DeepGit 3.0 and older
- SmartCVS

Log4J 1.x should not be affected by [CVE-2021-44228 ("Log4JShell")](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-44228/), but there is another important vulnerability [CVE-2019-17571](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17571/) affecting Log4J 1.x. For this reason, we have decided to remove the affected versions from our download archive.
