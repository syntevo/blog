Most likely the last milestone build before the SmartGit release candidate is available. SmartGit is a client for the distributed version control system (DVCS) Git.

The detailed changes can be found in the [change log](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/changelog-eap.txt).

We would like to invite everyone to give this build a try and share your ideas with us. Join the [SmartGit community](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/community.html)!

## Note:

SmartGit requires a Git installation on your system.
