Starting today, AVG anti-virus scanner reports a couple of SmartSVN's files on Windows as trojan ([more details here](http://blog.syntevo.com/2009/08/13/1250179800000.html)). We have just received following email from the AVG Customer Services which confirms the false positives and gives instructions on how to deal with them:

_Unfortunately, the current virus database version may detect the mentioned virus on some legitimate applications. We can confirm that it is a false alarm. We would like to inform you that the false positive will be removed in the next Definitions update. Please update your AVG and if a new Definitions update was downloaded, check whether the file is still detected._

_If you need to restore deleted files from AVG Virus Vault you can do it this way:_

_- Open AVG user interface.
- Choose "Virus Vault" option from the "History" menu.
- Locate the file that was incorrectly removed and select it (one click).
- Click on the "Restore" button._
