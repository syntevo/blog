We are proud to announce the first public version of SmartGit, a client for the distributed version control system [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

We would like to invite everyone to give this first milestone build a try and share your ideas with us. Please do not yet expect a mature client like SmartSVN or SmartCVS, but expect SmartGit improving quickly. :)

SmartGit requires a Git installation on your system. Basic commands like initializing a new repository, cloning an existing one, staging, unstaging and committing files, fetching remote and pushing local changes, graphical log, simple branching and merging already work.
