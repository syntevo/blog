## Fixed Bugs
- Changes view:
	- internal error trying to stage "left" block at first line
	- Unstage Selection: internal error for last block in unified diff view
- Changes view/File Compare/...: parsing was broken if token ended with 32-bit char (e.g. "emoji")
- Cherry-Pick/Squash Commits: possible internal error related to invalid Git commits
- Fetch more: after unshallowing commits graph is not refreshed
- Git-Flow, Init: failed in empty repository; now it creates initial empty commit if required
- GitLab: possible error "Object 'sha' not found"
- Init: may fail to create objects in case of file system problems
- Investigate: initial switch from Blame to Diff view gives empty panel
- Log Graph (and Commits view):
	- for email-only `.mailmap` lines, the original Author name was lost
	- for `.mailmap` lines containing `<>`, mapping was not applied
- Rebase: some warning dialogs showed "Merge" instead of "Rebase" in title
- Refresh:
	- possible internal error if `mailmap.file` contains an invalid path
	- possible error "The process cannot access the file because another process has locked a portion of the file" for untracked-missing rename detection
- Rename: was not applicable any more for submodules (regression since 22.1)
- Remove: was not applicable any more for submodules (regression since 22.1)
- Window \| Reset Perspective: kept previous layout
- Standard window:
	- possible internal error if a dialog occurs (e.g. master password dialog) while dragging a tab
	- internal error trying to modify toolbar with "Basic" feature set
	- Graph: internal error when toggling "Show Tags" before graph has been loaded
- Linux:
	- File Compare (and other editors): internal error undoing changes after having typed Chinese characters with Pinyin
- Windows:
	- possible error "Failed to invoke filter 'lfs'"
	- possible errors related to invalid HOME

## Other Noteworthy Changes
- Clone:
	- GitHub: improve error message if authentication fails due to outdated username/password
- Conflict Solver: the Base window now has its own window bounds
- Evaluation: more possibilities to copy evaluation-IDs for expired evaluations
- Log and Working Tree window: optionally hide *Toggle 'Assume Unchanged'* and *Toggle 'Skip Worktree'* commands by setting the low-level property `file.contextMenu.toggleRareFileStates` to `false`
- macOS:
	- Setup wizard: when searching repositories avoid scanning into directories known to trigger macOS to show a confirmation dialog
