## New Features, Improvements
- Log and Working Tree window:
	- Files view: Fix Case-Change now available in context menu

## Fixed Bugs
- Changes view: in Unified mode, too few selection-related operations were available (regression from 23.1)
- GitHub:
	- reading pull requests failed if page limit was reached
	- fixed misleading error message if OAuth token was invalid
- GitHub Enterprise:
	- could not add hosting provider
	- possible error trying to read pull request comments
- Preferences:
	- Git config: modifications were not saved (regression from 23.1)
- Remove Worktree: removing or opening the repository in one window while removing the worktree in another caused internal errors
- Reverting files from a commit produced weird default commit message
- Standard window:
	- Commit: internal error when committing to detached HEAD and having the Push option selected
- Log window:
	- Graph: misleading empty-message in several scenarios, e.g. when filtering
- Log and Working Tree window:
	- the low-level property `commit.allowToCreateEmpty` did not work properly

## Other Noteworthy Changes
- Setup wizard: show a warning and switch back to Style page when having selected the Standard window, but registered a non-commercial license
