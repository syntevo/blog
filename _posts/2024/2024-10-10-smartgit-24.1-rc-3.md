## Fixed Bugs
- Clone, Directory Name input field (Windows): internal error entering a drive letter followed by colon
- Commit dialog: mnemonics for controls after the message input field did not work any more (regression)
- GitLab: possible error "Token was revoked" after updating personal access token in the Preferences
- Log graph: the first filtering caused a noticable flickering
- Split Off Files: setting the low-level property `log.splitOffFiles.prefix` to empty produces commit message starting with "null"
- Syntax:
	- Markdown: characters >= 0x80h were not parsed correctly
	- Shellscript: backslash in conditional expression was not parsed correctly
	- several languages: possible internal error with `\` on end of line
