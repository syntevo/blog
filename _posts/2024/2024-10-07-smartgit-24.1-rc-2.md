## Fixed Bugs
- Clone: changing a missing Git executable in the occurring preferences dialog required the Clone wizard to be reopened
- Commit dialog: Alt+M does not select message input field, but popup button
- File Compare (Show Changes): line endings could become duplicated if they were stored as CR LF in the repository
- Syntax:
	- HTML: incorrect parsing
- Working Tree window: working tree with `--separate-git-dir` is not correctly refreshed
- Linux:
	- maximizing a window remembers the location `(0, 0)` instead of the previous one
	- Ubuntu 24.04: not restoring window's maximized state
