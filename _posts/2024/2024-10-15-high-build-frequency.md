You may have noticed that we frequently release preview builds, release candidates, and bug-fix updates.
Does this mean SmartGit has an unusually high number of bugs?
We donâ€™t believe so.
In fact, we take any issues that arise very seriously.

Our goal is to continuously improve the product, which is why we often release new versions.
By doing so, you benefit from:

- earlier access to more stable, refined versions, and
- the opportunity to help test our fixes over a longer period, ensuring a smoother final release.

We appreciate your support and patience as we work to make SmartGit the best it can be.
