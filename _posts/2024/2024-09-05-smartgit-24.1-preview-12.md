A new preview build for **SmartGit 24.1** is available for download.

- [Download](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/preview)

## New Features, Improvements
- Changes view: Apply Line should work for equal-size-block, too (similar to File Compare)
- GitHub: ability to select issue similar to JIRA support
- Investigate: optionally follows insignificant merges (experimental)
- Rollback: should work (for Files) in Graph diff mode, too, if one of the selected commits is HEAD
- Standard window:
	- Commit: allow Push option also for local (non-tracking) branches
	- Directories: Subdirectory Log
	- Finish Feature: pull only relevant branches

## Fixed Bugs
- Changes view: misleading "Submodule does not exist" error for non-existing commits
- Git configuration: custom HOME env variable (and thus custom `~/.gitconfig`) was not honored anymore
- GitHub:
	- internal error when refreshing pull requests
	- NPE when author was "ghost" (obsolete user account)
	- NPE while iterating pages for Repositories
- Graph: several drag and drop related regressions
- Investigate: possible error "Could not resolve HEAD"
- Remove: should not be enabled for submodules (it's not working anyway)
- Revert: extended rebase logic
- Split Commit: could not commit with Commit dialog (but with Commit view)
- MacOS:
	- Repository | Edit Git Config | Repository: could immediately hide the window if the mouse was over a window part that showed a tooltip
	- possible umlaut problem
- Standard window:
	- internal error when selecting virtual and regular commit

## Other Noteworthy Changes
- About dialog: show license identifier (like Contact Support)
- "External credential helper detected" notification: optionally make SmartGit handle the authentication
- GitHub/GitLab/others: improve error handling
- Index Editor and other windows: improve felt opening performance
- license-server: proxy support
- Preferences:
	- Git Config: show paths of detected Git config files
- Stash Selection: improve error handling if selection contains conflicting (= unstashable) files
- update SWT:
	- workaround for https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/924
	- workaround for performance problem for characters < 0x20
- Working Tree window:
	- Branches: show content for bare repositories, too
- Working Tree/Log windows:
	- Checkout: for the Stash/Discard dialog in case of local changes, let the user confirm Discard a second time
