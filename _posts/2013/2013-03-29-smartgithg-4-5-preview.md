For [SmartGit/Hg](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/), our graphical Git and Hg client with SVN support, public preview builds for the upcoming version 4.5 are available. The most important changes are ([detailed change log](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/changelog-eap.txt)):

Each text editor now shows the content **syntax colored** depending on the file type.

To stage or unstage simple changes, you don't need to open the Index Editor any more, but just click the \[<<\], \[>>\] or \[X\] buttons in the Changes tool window. You even can just stage/unstage inner-line changes.

The improved Blame shows more information in a compact style.

New versions or latest builds automatically can be downloaded and used after a restart - platform independent on OS X, Windows and Linux.

The file and directory tools now have own menu items and configurable shortcuts.

When a pull, switch or checkout command fails because of local changes, they can be automatically stashed before retrying the command and reapplying the stashed changes.

You are welcome to give it a try!
