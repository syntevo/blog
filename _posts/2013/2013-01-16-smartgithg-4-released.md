We are proud to announce the official release of [SmartGit/Hg 4](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/). SmartGit/Hg is a graphical front-end for the distributed version control systems Git and Mercurial, which also can be used to work with Subversion repositories. SmartGit/Hg runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

SmartGit/Hg can be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes (e.g. OpenSource developers). For commercial use or if support is needed, licenses have to be [purchased](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/purchase.html). The licenses include 1 year of free updates and either 90 days or 1 year of e-mail support.

The SmartGit/Hg 4 release focuses on (see [what's new](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/whatsnew.html)):

- Annotate for Git,
- Reorder, join commits (interactive rebase),
- Improved Mercurial support (e.g. rebase, phases),
- Full SVN-properties support (especially when merging),
- stream-lined work flows.
