We have started with the internationalization/language localization of SmartGit ([UserEcho topic 76)](https://smartgit.userecho.com/communities/1/topics/76-). The first language we are working on is Simplified Chinese. If you are a native Chinese speaker, your contributions would be much appreciated. For details on how to contribute, please have a look at the [Internationalization How-To](https://docs.syntevo.com/SmartGit/HowTos/Internationalization-for-developers-authors-.html).
