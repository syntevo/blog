We are delighted to announce the official release of [SmartGit 19.1](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/). First, we want to thank all users who have tested the preview versions and provided valuable feedback. Without you, the progress would not have been possible!

We have taken the SmartGit user feedback at [smartgit.userecho.com](https://smartgit.userecho.com) seriously and implemented some of the most requested features. SmartGit 19.1

- improves the **performance**, especially for large repositories,
- improves the **dark theme** (on Windows 10 the scrollbars and menus became dark, on macOS 10.14 the system light/dark option is considered),
- improves log **graph display** for rebasing (shows done/pending commits),
- makes the **split-commit work-flow intuitively** understandable and safer,
- support for Git-Flow AVH,
- better uses the screen space by combining the Details and Commit Message views into the Commit view,
- allows to perform directoy-based commands in the log,
- and improved a lot of other existing features.
