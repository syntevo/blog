In SmartGit, SmartSVN and SmartSynchronize you can easily scroll from change to change by using the mouse wheel over the area between the left and right file content views.

On Windows 10 you need to enable a system option to make this working:

- open Windows' _Settings_
- select _Devices_
- on the _Mouse_ page select the option _**Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them**_
