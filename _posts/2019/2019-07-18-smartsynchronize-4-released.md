We are delighted to announce the official release of [SmartSynchronize 4](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsynchronize/). First, we want to thank all users who have tested the preview versions and provided valuable feedback. Without you, the progress would not have been possible!

The biggest change in SmartSynchronize 4 is the addition of a new **dual-pane file manager**. After searching for a platform independent, decent dual-pane file manager, we found only very few options that lacked in one or another area significantly. So we decided to write our own one and added it to SmartSynchronize. It focuses on _keyboard-centric_ usage - who remembers the common commander shortcuts using F-keys will feel quickly familiar with SmartSynchronize' file manager. One nice feature is that it remembers all used paths, so you can access them quickly later by using the Ctrl+P shortcut (Cmd+P on macOS). For simple navigation we integrated the directory navigation using the cursor keys - some users may know this as _lynx-like motion_. Check out [What's New](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsynchronize/whats-new) for a more detailed list of improvements.

SmartSynchronize is a **multi-platform file manager** with **file compare**, **file merge** and **directory compare** tools. SmartSynchronize runs on 64-bit systems of Windows, macOS and Linux.

SmartSynchronize can be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes (e.g. by OpenSource developers, students, teachers or certain welfare institutions). For commercial use or if support is needed, you can [purchase commercial licenses](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsynchronize/purchase) (or for an reduced price as addon to SmartGit or SmartSVN).
