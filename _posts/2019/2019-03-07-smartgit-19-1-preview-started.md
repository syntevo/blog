The first public build of **SmartGit 19.1** is available for download.

In this release we are concentrating on performance improvements and consolidating existing features, so making them better usable. The working tree and index support for the Log introduced in 18.2 has been further improved, e.g. by (optionally) showing a directory tree, so you can perform also directory-based commands. We also improved drawing speed of the commit graph significantly.
