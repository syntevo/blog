It is following bug in SWT

[bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show\_bug.cgi?id=474096](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=474096)

and we don't know of a work-around for now. We would like to encourage you to **vote for this bug** at bugs.eclipse.org, so it will get the necessary priority.

**Update Aug-18-2015** Though the SWT team has fixed it, Microsoft also released a fix for Windows 10 which solved this problem.
