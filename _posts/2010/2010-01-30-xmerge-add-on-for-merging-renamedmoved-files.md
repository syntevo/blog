When files in branches have been moved or renamed, merging with SVN easily can get cumbersome. xMerge ("cross-merge"), which is licensed as a separate add-on to SmartSVN, fixes this shortcoming and helps you to merge moved or renamed files automatically and safely. For more information refer to [xMerge Add-on](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/xmerge-addon.html).
