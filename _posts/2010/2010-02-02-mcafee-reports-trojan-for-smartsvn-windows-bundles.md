Approximately a half year ago, [AVG erroneously reported](/2009/08/13/1250187863166.html) smartsvn.exe as a trojan. Now some McAfee virus scanners also find a non-existent trojan "Artemis!F5A198ED6E96".

If your McAfee scanner also reports the trojan, please verify the reported files using other virus scanners, for example, using the webservice [virusscan.jotti.org](http://virusscan.jotti.org/). Then, if you are sure it is a false-positive, report it to McAfee as described in their [documentation](http://service.mcafee.com/faqdocument.aspx?id=TS100095&lang=en_US&prior_tid=2&AnswerID=16777216&turl==http%3A%2F%2Fkb.mcafee.com%2Finfocenter%2Findex%3Fpage%3Dcontent%26id%3DTS100095%26actp%3Dsearch).
