Our team had the opportunity to attend the **WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Berlin**, one of Europe‚Äôs largest developer events ‚Äî and this year, we brought along a special guest: **SmartGitty**, our mascot. 

### Connecting with the Developer Community

In the **Community Area**, we introduced SmartGit to many curious visitors, discussed real-world Git workflows, and explored how SmartGit can support both beginners, experienced developers and teams in their daily work.

It was a great chance to:
- Exchange ideas with other Git users
- Talk about the "smart side" of SmartGit
- Explore current trends in software development
- Listen to high-quality talks from a wide range of speakers

### Introducing SmartGitty üê±

**SmartGitty** is more than just our visual mascot ‚Äî she represents the personality behind SmartGit: smart, relaxed and cool.
#### Why a cat?
Because cats are curious, independent, and always land on their feet ‚Äî just like we want **you** to feel when working with SmartGit.

At WeAreDevelopers, SmartGitty made her first live appearance ‚Äî as a **life-size figure** ready for photos. In future you'll also find her in our **tutorials, animations, and feature explainers**.

Even a serious tool can have a friendly interface ‚Äî and a recognizable face.


Thanks to everyone who stopped by, shared feedback, or simply took a photo with SmartGitty. We enjoyed the exchange and look forward to seeing some of you again ‚Äî online or at upcoming events.
