**SmartGit 20.2 is the only version which we officially support on macOS 11.** There are some known UI-related problems which we are working on.

**SmartGit 20.1 is not officially supported** on macOS 11. Still, according to user's feedback and our own experience, SmartGit 20.1 is basically working on macOS 11, however there are a couple of known UI-related problems: some of them are resulting in crashes, others only resulting in UI-glitches. The most pressing of them are already resolved in version 20.2. If you are running into any unexpected problems, please upgrade.

**SmartGit 19.1 and earlier are not supported** on macOS 11. These versions are known to have several problems on macOS 11. We definitely recommend to upgrade to version 20.2.
