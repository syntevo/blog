For Linux we are offering since ever a .tar.gz bundle and since a couple of years a .deb bundle.

We recommend the .tar.gz bundle, because

- it can be installed simply by unpacking anywhere,
- it can autoupdate itself to any newer version, even if the installation directory needs to be updated,
- it ships will all dependencies (except of libcurl), including Git and JRE,
- workarounds like for outdated GTK3 versions are easier to handle
