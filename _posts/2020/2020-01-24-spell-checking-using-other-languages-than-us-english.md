SmartGit and SmartSVN by default come with a US-English dictionary. To use spell-checking for other languages, you can use, e.g. [LibreOffice dictionaries](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions?getCategories=Dictionary&getCompatibility=any). Please rename the `.oxt` file extension to `.zip` and unpack the `*.aff` and `*.dic` files into the same directory of your choice. Now you can create a new dictionary in the SmartGit or SmartSVN preferences by selecting the `*.dic` file.
