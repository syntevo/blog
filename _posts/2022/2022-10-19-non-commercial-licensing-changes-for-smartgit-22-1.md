For SmartGit 22.1, we have changed the non-commercial licensing conditions to be more permissive overall. SmartGit is now free for:

1. **everyone who spends the majority of their work on open-source projects** (before, it was only "to actively work on open-source projects", which is significantly more restrictive)
2. **employees or students on public academic institutions** (before, it was only "for learning or teaching on a public academic institution")
3. **hobby users**, with certain limitations on the repositories; requires [version 23.1 preview](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/preview/), see also [this blog post](https://www.syntevo.com/blog/?p=5488)

##### Technically enforced licensing conditions

The new licensing conditions are now enforced by requiring a [non-commercial license](https://www.syntevo.com/register-non-commercial/).

We have decided to take this step, because the current proportion of non-commercial users is above 60%. For a B2B-product in the Software industry, this is in stark contrast with the overall number of Software developers compared to the number of primary open source developers and academic users ðŸ˜‰

##### SmartSVN and SmartSynchronize

We have applied the same licensing changes for SmartSVN 14.3 and SmartSynchronize 4.4. Your [non-commercial license](https://www.syntevo.com/register-non-commercial/) will work with these products out-of-the-box.
