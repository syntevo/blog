We are delighted to announce the official release of [SmartGit 22.1](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/). First, we want to thank all users who have tested the preview versions and provided valuable feedback. Without you, the progress would not have been possible!

We have taken the SmartGit user feedback seriously and implemented some of the most requested features. SmartGit 22.1 comes with

- the new [Standard window](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/standard-window/) to make workflows easier,
- improved **log graph** display,
- improved **Git repository** performance and flexibility,
- multi-commit **cherry-pick** and **revert** can be continued after conflict,
- better display of **LFS** states,
- **Syntax coloring** support for new languages (Crystal, Zig, Groovy),
- and improved a lot of other existing features.
