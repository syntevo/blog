We are delighted to announce the official release of [SmartSynchronize 4.3](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsynchronize/). First, we want to thank all users who have tested the preview versions and provided valuable feedback. Without you, the progress would not have been possible!

In SmartSynchronize 4.3 we concentrated on improving existing features, especially the file manager. For macOS there is also a separate ARM64 (M1) bundle beside the one for Intel machines. Check out [What's New](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsynchronize/whats-new) for a more detailed list of improvements.

SmartSynchronize is a **multi-platform, keyboard-centric file manager** with **file compare**, **file merge** and **directory compare** tools. SmartSynchronize runs on 64-bit systems of Windows, macOS and Linux.

SmartSynchronize can be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes (e.g. by OpenSource developers, students, teachers or certain welfare institutions). For commercial use or if support is needed, you can [purchase commercial licenses](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsynchronize/purchase) (or for an reduced price as addon to SmartGit or SmartSVN). The commercial licenses include up to 3 years of e-mail support and up to life-long free updates.
