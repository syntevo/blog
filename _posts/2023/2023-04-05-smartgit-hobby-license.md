We have underestimated the amount of users who have used SmartGit's non-commercial option for sole hobby purposes which has been [dropped since version 22.1](https://www.syntevo.com/blog/?p=5363).

Hence, for **version 23.1** (starting with [preview 6](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/preview/)) we have introduced a SmartGit license for hobby usage. This new license type can be used to work on repositories:

- where you are the only committer/author or
- which are publicly available.

Please request it [here](https://www.syntevo.com/register-non-commercial/#hobby).
