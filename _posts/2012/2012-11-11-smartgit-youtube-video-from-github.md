[GitHub](https://github.com/) has created a nice little [SmartGit feature demo on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4meQTBgZcw), which we want to recommend you.

A few comments from us:

- at 3:10 you rather should use Graph|Select Branches (or the triangle button right beside the coloring combobox) to show non-current branches; Query|Load All Commits is meant to be used for loading ("dead-end") commits which are not referenced by a branch or tag
- at 4:04 you don't have to stage changed with SmartGit; instead you also can commit them directly
