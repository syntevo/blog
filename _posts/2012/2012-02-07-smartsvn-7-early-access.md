SmartSVN 7 supports the new Subversion 1.7 working copy format.

For this early access build, almost all of the _official_ Subversion 1.7 functionality has been implemented, except of _Merging_ and _Creating patches_. Most of the extended SmartSVN-functionality (like _detecting moves_) is not working yet.

All missing functionality will be delivered soon with the next early-access builds.
