For [SmartSVN](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/), our graphical SVN client, the first public preview build for the upcoming version 7.5 is available. The most important changes are the use of a different GUI library to make SmartSVN look native (SWT instead of AWT/Swing) and stream-lined existing features ([detailed change log](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/changelog-eap.txt)).

You are welcome to give it a try!
