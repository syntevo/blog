- [JoÃ£o Morais:](http://twitter.com/jcsmorais/statuses/259187096391127040) #smartgit it's getting better in each version.. just updated to the latest version and realized it now has submodules support! #nice
- [Tor Helland:](http://twitter.com/midiar/statuses/258882285342949378) New #SmartGit 4 preview from @syntevo really is a joy to use with its interactive manipulation of unpushed commits.
- [Randall DeFauw:](http://twitter.com/rdefauw/statuses/253173746444140544) I like SmartGit myself. Cross-platform, free for personal use, cheap for business use.
- [Steven Wu:](http://twitter.com/designtodevelop/statuses/250154367292944385) The best #Git GUI tool for Windows by far is #SmartGit
- [Daniel Collin:](http://twitter.com/daniel_collin/statuses/247238151930785792) On windows I found that SmartGit (yeah it supports hg) was the best front-end for hg.
- [Renaud BÃ©dard:](http://twitter.com/renaudbedard/statuses/246328029524140032) Oh wow, SmartGit is really really good. Goodbye TortoiseGit, you will not be missed!
