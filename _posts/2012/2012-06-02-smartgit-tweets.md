Some SmartGit user feedback from twitter:

- [ldn\_tech\_exec:](http://twitter.com/ldn_tech_exec/statuses/208341336259182592) @aral smartgit is meant to be better than all those, but sourcetree my fav. GitHub for mac is too unstable and slow
- [Filip Vanderstappen:](http://twitter.com/Filipvds/statuses/208175191275208705) @GarethRedfern I think SmartGit is one of the best and feature rich apps for Windows.
- [Nathanael Jones:](http://twitter.com/nathanaeljones/statuses/207953775099527168) @cmsimike High reliability. I have 2 dozen repos, and I leave SmartGit running 24x7. It's fast, smooth, intuitive. I don't have to think.
- [Fahmi:](http://twitter.com/fahmi_ph/statuses/206429296712101888) ok, â€ª#smartgitâ€¬ was really awesome, very light and easy to use..
- [Ivan Zlatev:](http://twitter.com/ivanzlatev/statuses/204965395654914049) Failing to see the usefulness of @GitHub for Windows TBH. Pretty,but not functional for anyth. but commit and checkout. SmartGit however is.
- [Brian Franco:](http://twitter.com/brianfranco/statuses/204597112342708224) Well that's odd. I couldn't push my test app from git console or TortoiseGIT but it worked fine in Smartgit. I must've messed somethin up :D

- [Lex Li:](http://twitter.com/lextm/statuses/206306667703439360) Finally found a good GUI based Git tool on Linux http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/quick â€¦ Free for non-commercial usage such as open source development

- [James Eggers:](http://twitter.com/JamesEggers/statuses/204616182593093635) A number of guys here in the office use SmartGit and love it. I'm a command line guy but from what I've seen it's solid.
