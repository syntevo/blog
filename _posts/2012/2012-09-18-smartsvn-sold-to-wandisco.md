We're proud to announce that [WANdisco International Ltd.](http://www.wandisco.com) has acquired our SVN client SmartSVN to broaden their SVN portfolio.

We at Syntevo have started development of SmartSVN in 2004. Starting with a small group of enthusiastic users, SmartSVN nowadays is the most important multi-platform SVN client. We are sure that WANdisco, as a leading Subversion company, will be able to leverage SmartSVN's position in the market even higher. You can find SmartSVN now at [smartsvn.com](http://www.smartsvn.com).

We want to thank our long-time friends and partners at [TMate Software s.r.o.](http://svnkit.com/) who provided the excellent technical base library SVNKit used by SmartSVN, as well as our active user base who have guided us to the direction into which SmartSVN evolved.

## Who is WANdisco?

WANdisco is a leading provider of Apache Subversion based software and services for the enterprise. The company's products include Subversion MultiSite, Subversion Access Control and Subversion Clustering.

## Will this affect my purchased SmartSVN license?

No, WANdisco will continue to support Syntevo's SmartSVN users and provide the 1 year of free updates for them.

## Where should I raise issues in the future?

The best place to raise any general issues is on WANdisco's dedicated [SmartSVN forum](http://www.svnforum.org/forums/63).
