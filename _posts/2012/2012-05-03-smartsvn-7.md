We are proud to announce the release of [SmartSVN 7](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/) (codename: "dormouse"): finally, more than 7 months after the official Subversion 1.7 release, SmartSVN now also supports the SVN 1.7 working copy format — a "Thank you" to all of our users for their patience!

SmartSVN is a graphical client for the Open Source version control system Subversion (SVN) and runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. SmartSVN is aimed at professionals who demand a reliable, efficient and well-supported SVN client for their daily business.

SmartSVN 7 supports the new Subversion 1.7 working copy format and comes with a couple of smaller improvements that are listed in the [change log](http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/changelog.txt).
