For [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/), our graphical Git and Hg client, the first public preview build for the upcoming version 4 is available. The most important changes are interactive rebase, annotate/blame, improved Hg and SVN support as well as improved branching work-flows ([detailed change log](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/changelog-eap.txt)).

You are welcome to give it a try!
