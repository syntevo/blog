- [Gwenn Guihal:](https://twitter.com/_myrddin_/statuses/215388488768565248) I have searched for a long time : The best SVN client for MacOs is SmartSVN (free furthermore) (as easy as Tortoise)
- [Seth Carstens:](https://twitter.com/sethcarstens/statuses/225692200535744512) we use SmartSVN and SmartGIT. Have used them for years now after a Tortoise-SVN update corrupted my local SVN files
- [Russell Heimlich:](https://twitter.com/kingkool68/statuses/238678915005161474) SmartSVN is awesome. And cross platform.
- [Richard Brown:](https://twitter.com/chronosafe/statuses/240428136993521664) Oddly enough Iâ€™m liking the Git client SmartGit on Windows. My favorite Mac client Towers could learn a couple of things from it.
- [Stuart Thompson:](https://twitter.com/stuartthompson/statuses/240180378181185536) I am a long time GiT command line user but recently started SmartGit. Doesn't solve all of my problems, but in the simple cases it's great.
- [Dan Clarke:](https://twitter.com/dracan/statuses/236786134758334465) Very impressed with the SmartGit Windows Git client. Think this might have moved me away from Git Extensions!
- [Amir-abbas Abdolali:](https://twitter.com/amir_abbas/statuses/236424170991411200) I have github too but smartgit has more features.
- [Jered:](https://twitter.com/jeredh/statuses/235841666198683648) Nice! Give SmartGit a look if you're in need a decent GUI. Windows version works great, at least.
- [Peter Mescalchin:](https://twitter.com/magnetikonline/statuses/229941462178070530) SmartGit 3.0.8 bug fix released - really enjoying this as a frontend GUI to Git when the command line won't cut it
- [Scott Jehl:](https://twitter.com/scottjehl/statuses/228459895949770752) +1 for SmartGit - works well. I tend to use Git from cmd line, but the GUI can be faster in certain workflows, for me
- [darrenmothersele.com:](https://twitter.com/mothersele/statuses/225232501801631744) just started using SmartGit - it really does make merging fun!
