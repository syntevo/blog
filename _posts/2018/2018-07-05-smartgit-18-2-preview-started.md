The first public build of **SmartGit 18.2** is available for download.

The most important change is that the Log has now **support for Working Tree and Index** operations, e.g. Commit, and functions from the Journal (reorder commits by drag and drop, squash, edit commit message) have been added, too. Because it also allows to change repositories, it can be used as main window.

The Linux bundles not only have a Java Runtime Environment bundled, but also Git, so it can be used out-of-the-box without the need to install further dependencies.
