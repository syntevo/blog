We are delighted to announce the official release of [SmartGit 18.2](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/). First, we want to thank all users who have tested the preview versions and provided valuable feedback. Without you, the progress would not have been possible!

We have taken the SmartGit user feedback at [smartgit.userecho.com](https://smartgit.userecho.com) seriously and implemented some of the most requested features. We integrated **Working Tree features to the Log** by making the Log window a full alternative to the Working Tree window, added an **enhanced Git-Lab integration** with support for merge-requests and comments, added the major **Git-LFS** commands and improved a lot of existing features. Check out [What's New](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/whats-new) for a more detailed list of improvements in version 18.2.

SmartGit is a graphical front-end for the distributed version control systems Git which also can be used to work with Subversion repositories. SmartGit runs on 64-bit systems of Windows, macOS and Linux.

SmartGit can be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes (e.g. by OpenSource developers, students, teachers or certain welfare institutions). For commercial use or if support is needed, you can [purchase commercial licenses](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase). The commercial licenses include up to 3 years of e-mail support and up to life-long free updates. For early adopters, we are offering up to **40% early adopter discount** until Dec 14th 2018. Details can be found when launching SmartGit or by our Twitter, Facebook and Google+ channels.
